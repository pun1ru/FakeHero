description: Statically analyze the configured firmware ELF through EmberProbe - Flash and RAM usage per section plus the largest functions and variables. No probe or hardware needed. Use when the user asks how much Flash/RAM the firmware uses, what occupies the most space, why the binary grew, or wants a memory footprint report.

# MCU ELF Analyze

Use `scripts/analyze-elf.js` from this skill directory. This is a pure static analysis of the workspace's configured ELF — it never touches the probe or the target, so it works with no hardware attached and does not conflict with sampling or downloading.

## Before you run

- **Applies to**: static firmware footprint analysis — Flash and RAM per section plus the largest functions and variables.
- **Requires**: the EmberProbe Agent Bridge (to read the selected ELF path). **No probe or hardware is needed** — “no hardware” here does not mean “no Bridge”; a Bridge failure is an extension/activation problem, not a wiring problem.
- **Preconditions**: an ELF is selected (else `ELF_NOT_CONFIGURED`) and is readable, not mid-rebuild (else `ELF_READ_FAILED`).
- **Side effects**: none — read-only, no hardware access.
- **Success evidence**: the `flash`/`ram`/`topSymbols` JSON. Static RAM only (heap/stack are runtime properties). A footprint report says nothing about whether the firmware actually runs.

For failure handling, retry limits, cross-skill routing, and result scoping, read [../_emberprobe/agent-workflow.md](../_emberprobe/agent-workflow.md).

```bash
node <skill-dir>/scripts/analyze-elf.js --workspace <workspace>
node <skill-dir>/scripts/analyze-elf.js --workspace <workspace> --top 30
node <skill-dir>/scripts/analyze-elf.js --workspace <workspace> --map build/firmware.map
node <skill-dir>/scripts/analyze-elf.js --workspace <workspace> --linker-script STM32H750.ld
```

`--top` limits the largest-symbol ranking (default 20, max 100). `--map` and
`--linker-script` select the layout source explicitly; without them the extension
uses the ELF-adjacent `.map` or the unique workspace linker script.

## Interpreting the result

The JSON on stdout contains:

- `flash`: total bytes and per-section list of everything programmed to Flash (`.isr_vector`, `.text`, `.rodata`, plus the load copy of `.data`), addresses are LMAs.
- `ram`: total bytes and per-section list of runtime RAM usage (`.data`, `.bss`, etc.), addresses are VMAs. `.data` legitimately appears in both lists.
- `topSymbols`: largest functions and objects with `kind`, `section`, `size`, `address`.
- `regions`: every region declared by the selected `.map` or `.ld`, including zero-use
  regions such as H750's `RAM_D2`, `RAM_D3`, and `ITCMRAM`. Each entry has `origin`,
  `capacity`, `used`, `sectionBytes`, `percent`, and section details. `used` is the
  high-water span from the region origin and includes linker reservations and gaps;
  `sectionBytes` is the de-duplicated section-range total.
- `source` and `diagnostics`: the layout file used and actionable messages for an
  ambiguous source, stale map, unmapped section, or unsupported linker expression.

Report totals in human units (KiB) and highlight the top consumers. To compute a Flash utilization percentage, combine `flash.total` with the chip's `flashSize` from the mcu-chip-info skill — do not guess the chip capacity from the ELF.

Note: the report includes linker-reserved heap/stack sections when they are present in
the ELF. It does not measure runtime heap/stack peaks or free RAM.

## Failure diagnostics

On failure, parse the JSON `diagnostic` on stderr. `ELF_NOT_CONFIGURED` means no ELF is selected (use mcu-config), `ELF_READ_FAILED` means the file is missing or being rebuilt.
