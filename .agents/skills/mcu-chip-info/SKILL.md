description: Selectively read attached MCU identity, debug-link, or runtime information through EmberProbe. Use only when the user asks about the connected chip, core, UID, flash size, vendor fingerprint (genuine ST vs compatible clone such as APM32/GD32/AT32), debugger, transport, voltage, target state, or CPU registers.

# MCU Chip Information

Use `scripts/read-chip.js` from this skill directory. EmberProbe owns the probe and enforces mutual exclusion.

## Before you run

- **Applies to**: reading attached MCU identity, debug-link, or runtime information (core, series, UID, Flash size, vendor fingerprint, debugger, transport, voltage, target state, CPU registers).
- **Requires**: the EmberProbe Agent Bridge, OpenOCD, a connected probe, and a powered target.
- **Preconditions**: the probe is free (single owner); request only the fields needed to answer.
- **Side effects**: read-only; briefly uses the probe with no persistent target change.
- **Success evidence**: the requested `identity`/`debug`/`runtime` fields are returned. Do not replace a specific probe/target/configuration diagnosis with a generic “service not running”.

For failure handling, retry limits, cross-skill routing, and result scoping, read [../_emberprobe/agent-workflow.md](../_emberprobe/agent-workflow.md).

```bash
node <skill-dir>/scripts/read-chip.js --workspace <workspace> --section identity
node <skill-dir>/scripts/read-chip.js --workspace <workspace> --fields core,series,deviceId,flashSize
node <skill-dir>/scripts/read-chip.js --workspace <workspace> --fields designer,authenticity,compatVendor,compatBrand
```

Sections are `identity`, `debug`, and `runtime`. If neither `--section` nor `--fields` is supplied, read `identity`. The `identity` section also carries the vendor fingerprint decoded from the CoreSight ROM table: `designer`/`designerCode` (JEP106 designer), `romPart`, and for chips claiming an STM32 series an `authenticity` verdict (`genuine` = real ST, `compatible` = clone; `compatVendor`/`compatBrand` name the maker, e.g. Geehy APM32, GigaDevice GD32). Request only the fields needed to answer the user. If EmberProbe reports that the probe is busy, do not start another OpenOCD process.

On failure, parse the stderr JSON diagnostic and use its `error.code`, `likelyCause`, `suggestedActions`, and `details.openocdTail`. Do not replace a specific probe/target/configuration diagnosis with a generic “service not running” explanation.
